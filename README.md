# U77,5 - a set of USB sound / DCF77 tools


## DESCRIPTION:

U77,5 is an open-source project under the GNU Lesser Public License.

Decoding the German DCF77 time signal per USB sound card and a receiver module, setting the system time.
"U" stands for USB and "77,5" for the full 77.5 kHz frequency of the time signal.

This project aims to demonstrate:

* how to build a "simple" hardware consisting of a DCF77 receiver and a low-cost USB soundcard.
* evaluation of the signal from the USB sound card (using PortAudio, see http://www.portaudio.com/ )

## No Warranty

Like explained in Lesser GPL you get no warranty at all.
We are not responsible for anything, even if you damage your hardware.
You should know that we experimented - not knowing what we do.
We are just lucky that it works for us.

Good Luck!
