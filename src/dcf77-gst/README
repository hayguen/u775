With this package you get a decoder for the German time signal "DCF77" as a
gstreamer plugin.

As hardware we took a DCF77 reciver module and a cheep USB Sound card. How it
looks like, how you have to wire them and where you can obtain the HW, you can
get from the projects page at http://u775.sourceforge.net . All in all it is a
very cheap sollution around 25 â‚¬uros.

In the examples directory you find a very simple usecase of this plugin. Feel
free to contribute better examples or applications.
